### Selection Sort

### How it works: 

The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly selecting either the smallest
or the largest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it
into the sorted portion of the list. This algorithm maintains two portions of
the array: 

- The subarray that is sorted 
- The remaining subarray that is unsorted

Subsequently after every iteration the smallest / largest element from the
unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the beginning of the unsorted
subarray. Therefore after every iteration the size of the sorted subarray
increases by one and the size of the unsorted subarray decreases by one. Upon
the completion of the Nth iteration (the size of the array) the sorted array is
achieved.

### Example

Let us consider the following array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

#### First Pass

Traversing the whole array from (i = 0) sequentially. After traversing through the array we observe that the 11 is the lowest value. Therefore we swap 64 with 11.

[64, 25, 12, 22, 11] → [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]

#### Second Pass

For the second pass, start traversing from the index position (i = 1) in a sequential manner. Upon traversing we find that the 12 is the least element. Hence we swap 12 with 25.

[11, 25, 12, 22, 64] → [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]

#### Third Pass

For the third pass, start traversing from the index position (i = 2) in a sequential manner. Upon traversing we find that the 22 is the smallest element and hence we 22 with 25.

[11, 12, 25, 22, 64] → [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

#### Fourth Pass

For the fourth pass, start traversing from the index positon (i = 3) in a sequential manner. Upon traversing we find that the 25 is the smallest element and hence we 25 with 25. 

[11, 12, 22, 25, 64] → [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

#### Fifth Pass

For the fifth and the final pass, the largest value present in the array automatically gets placed in the last position of the array. 

[11, 12, 22, 25, 64] → [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

### Analysis
#### Time complexity: O(N^2)

One loop for selecting an element from the array one by one = O(N)
Another loop to compare the selected element with every other element from the array = O(N)

Overall complexity = O(N) * O(N) = O(N * N) = O(N^2)

#### Space complexity: O(1)

It is O(1) because the extra memory is only used for the temporary variables while swapping two values in an array. The selection sort algorithm never uses more than O(N) swaps and hence can be used when the memory write is a costly operation.




### Maelstrom: A High-Performance Algorithm for Large-Scale Data Analysis

Are you struggling to analyze large and complex data sets? Look no further than Maelstrom, a high-performance algorithm designed for large-scale data analysis. With its unique approach to processing data, Maelstrom is revolutionizing the field of computer science.

### What is Maelstrom?

Maelstrom is a distributed machine learning algorithm that is designed to work with large and complex data sets. Unlike traditional algorithms, which operate on a single machine, Maelstrom can be distributed across multiple machines, allowing it to process massive amounts of data with ease.

#### Distributed Computing

Maelstrom uses a technique called distributed computing to break up data sets into smaller chunks, which are processed simultaneously across multiple machines. This allows for faster processing times and more efficient use of computing resources.

### How Does Maelstrom Work?

To use Maelstrom, you simply feed your data into the algorithm and let it do its magic. Maelstrom will automatically distribute the data across multiple machines and use machine learning techniques to analyze the data and uncover insights.

#### Scalability

One of the key benefits of Maelstrom is its scalability. As your data sets grow in size, Maelstrom can scale to meet your needs, without sacrificing performance or accuracy.

#### Real-Time Processing

Maelstrom is designed to process data in real-time, allowing for faster and more efficient analysis of data. This is especially important in industries such as finance and healthcare, where real-time data analysis can make a significant impact.

### Why Choose Maelstrom?
